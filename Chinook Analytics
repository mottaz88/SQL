# I'll work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
# The chinook database has 11 tables in it.

# employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. 
# It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.

# customers table stores customers data. 
# The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related. 

# The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc). 

# The invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).

# artists table stores artists data.
 
# albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.

# media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.

# genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
 
# tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.

# playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. 
# Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. 
# The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.
